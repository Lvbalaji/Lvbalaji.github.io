# Hello, I'm Loganatha Vishnu Balaji 👋

### Offensive Security Specialist | Red Teaming & Penetration Testing | Web Application Testing
**OSCP+ | CPTS | CRTP | OSWP**

### 🚀 Who Am I?

I am a results-driven cybersecurity professional with a specialized focus on **Offensive Security, Active Directory exploitation, and Network Penetration Testing**. My approach to security is rooted in the adversarial mindset—understanding exactly how attackers operate to build stronger defenses.

Currently based in **Ireland**, I am pursuing my **MSc in Cybersecurity** at **Munster Technological University**. When I am not in the classroom, I am usually deep in a terminal, sharpening my practical skills through rigorous certification exams and labs.

### 🛡️ Certifications

I believe in validating skills through the most practical, hands-on exams available in the industry:

* [**OSCP+ (Offensive Security Certified Professional Plus):** Earned in Jan 2025. Demonstrated full-scale testing capabilities, including rapid vulnerability identification and professional reporting under 24-hour constraints.
* **CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist):** Executed a comprehensive 10-day penetration test against simulated enterprise networks, pivoting through complex Active Directory infrastructures.
* **CRTP (Certified Red Teaming Professional):** Specialized in AD exploitation, enumeration, and privilege escalation to compromise domain controllers.
* **OSWP (Offensive Security Wireless Professional):** Proficient in auditing and attacking WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPA Enterprise networks.

### 💻 Technical Arsenal

My methodology is backed by extensive practice, including over **170+ labs on the PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.

* **Network & Infrastructure:** Infrastructure Enumeration, Pivoting & Tunneling (Chisel/Ligolo-ng), Traffic Analysis (Wireshark).
* **Active Directory:** Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, ACL Abuse, Delegation Attacks, BloodHound, PowerView.
* **Web Security:** OWASP Top 10, SQLi, SSRF, XXE, IDOR, HTTP Request Smuggling, JWT Attacks.
***Languages & Tools:** Python, Metasploit, Mimikatz, Impacket, CrackMapExec, Burp Suite.

### 🧠 Research & Projects

I am passionate about the intersection of Machine Learning and Security.
**Project: Unleashing Fileless Malware on Windows**
I designed a Machine Learning pipeline to analyze fileless malware techniques. By extracting obfuscated command patterns and shell words from PowerShell logs, I identified Decision Tree classifiers as a top performer (90% accuracy) in distinguishing malicious scripts from benign administrative tasks.

### 📫 Connect With Me

I use this space to publish writeups on CTFs, research on AD exploitation, and insights into new vulnerabilities. If you want to discuss Red Teaming or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out.
