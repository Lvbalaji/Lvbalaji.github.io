### 🚀 Who Am I?

[cite_start]I am a results-driven cybersecurity professional with a specialized focus on **Offensive Security, Active Directory exploitation, and Network Penetration Testing**[cite: 4]. My approach to security is rooted in the adversarial mindset—understanding exactly how attackers operate to build stronger defenses.

[cite_start]Currently based in **Ireland**, I am pursuing my **MSc in Cybersecurity** at **Munster Technological University**[cite: 38, 39]. When I am not in the classroom, I am usually deep in a terminal, sharpening my practical skills through rigorous certification exams and labs.

### 🛡️ Certifications

I believe in validating skills through the most practical, hands-on exams available in the industry:

* [cite_start]**OSCP+ (Offensive Security Certified Professional Plus):** Earned in Jan 2025. Demonstrated full-scale testing capabilities, including rapid vulnerability identification and professional reporting under 24-hour constraints[cite: 11, 13, 14].
* [cite_start]**CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist):** Executed a comprehensive 10-day penetration test against simulated enterprise networks, pivoting through complex Active Directory infrastructures[cite: 15, 18].
* [cite_start]**CRTP (Certified Red Teaming Professional):** Specialized in AD exploitation, enumeration, and privilege escalation to compromise domain controllers[cite: 21, 24].
* [cite_start]**OSWP (Offensive Security Wireless Professional):** Proficient in auditing and attacking WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPA Enterprise networks[cite: 8, 10].

### 💻 Technical Arsenal

[cite_start]My methodology is backed by extensive practice, including over **170+ labs on the PortSwigger Web Security Academy**[cite: 5, 29].

* [cite_start]**Network & Infrastructure:** Infrastructure Enumeration, Pivoting & Tunneling (Chisel/Ligolo-ng), Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)[cite: 27, 30].
* [cite_start]**Active Directory:** Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, ACL Abuse, Delegation Attacks, BloodHound, PowerView[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Web Security:** OWASP Top 10, SQLi, SSRF, XXE, IDOR, HTTP Request Smuggling, JWT Attacks[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]**Languages & Tools:** Python, Metasploit, Mimikatz, Impacket, CrackMapExec, Burp Suite[cite: 28, 30].

### 🧠 Research & Projects

I am passionate about the intersection of Machine Learning and Security.
**Project: Unleashing Fileless Malware on Windows**
I designed a Machine Learning pipeline to analyze fileless malware techniques. [cite_start]By extracting obfuscated command patterns and shell words from PowerShell logs, I identified Decision Tree classifiers as a top performer (90% accuracy) in distinguishing malicious scripts from benign administrative tasks[cite: 32, 34, 35].
